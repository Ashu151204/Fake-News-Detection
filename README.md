Fake News Detection Model

A deep learning based Fake News Detection system that classifies news articles as Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning architectures.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🚀 Project Overview

Misinformation spreads rapidly through digital platforms. This project aims to build a reliable text classification model that can automatically detect fake news articles based on their textual content.

The notebook implements:

Text preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction using embeddings.

Model training and evaluation

Performance comparison

Prediction on new/unseen news articles

📂 Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing:

Title

Text

Label (Real / Fake)

Typical dataset structure:

title	text	label
News headline	Full article content	Fake / Real

The dataset used is publicly available (e.g., Kaggle Fake News dataset).
